                  <p>Paris, often called the <b>"City of Love"</b>, has a magic
                    that enchants visitors, especially those who have yearned
                    for its embrace. For someone who has long dreamt of
                    visiting, the anticipation builds into a crescendo of
                    excitement and longing.</p>
                  <p>In Paris, the air is filled with love, not just between
                    people but with the city itself. It’s a place where dreams
                    come alive.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Eiffel Tower 🗼</li>
                    <li>The Scene River 🚢</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>As the plane descends and the <b>Eiffel Tower</b> comes
                    into view, a wave of emotion sweeps over. The city, with its
                    timeless charm and romantic allure, feels like a long-lost
                    lover finally within reach. Stepping onto the cobblestone
                    streets, the heart beats faster, and every sight and sound
                    feels like a whisper of affection.</p>
                  <p>The first glimpse of the <b>Seine River</b>, glistening
                    under the golden sun, evokes a sense of wonder. The aroma of
                    freshly baked croissants from a nearby boulangerie is
                    irresistible, pulling one into a cozy café where the locals
                    sip their espressos and chat animatedly. Every corner of
                    Paris seems to tell a story, each building a testament to
                    its rich history and culture.</p>

                    Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She
                    packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
                    made herself on the way.</p>
